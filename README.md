 # task 3
 
 
 # PLEASE NOTE
 
 if you've noticed, for TASK ! AND TASK 2 alone there are two different repos for some of the proof and commits(NOT ALL), the Reason is that my team made use of a repo then had one person push all to a new repo for presenting which is the repo link in the proof sections of this readme.md file. So sorry for any inconvenience this may or may not have caused, we werent aware(As team Lead My Apologies are given).
 
So evidence of the commit is shown in the commit link section and the proof it was implemented or unmerged in the presented repo is shown in the proof section link, 
for any doubts the dates of the commits and pushes can be checked so as to confirm this was all done since and no foul play attempted.


for any further clarifications please contact me with @Godand on the slack channel.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH !
